The Linux operating system is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for various operating systems. The Linux kernel, on the other hand, is the core part of the Linux operating system responsible for managing hardware resources and providing essential services for other software.</p> <p>In casual usage, people often refer to the entire operating system as \"Linux,\" but strictly speaking, Linux is the kernel, and various distributions (distros) combine the Linux kernel with other components (such as system libraries, utilities, and software) to create complete operating systems. Popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS.</p>"}]}
